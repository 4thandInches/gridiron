# This model initially had no columns defined.  If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below

  encrypted_password: "password"

two:
  email: "zack@zack.com"
  encrypted_password: <%= BCrypt::Password.create("password") %>
